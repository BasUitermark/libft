Ok so we will actually do this a bit later and once u get it, its actually ez, it can get more complex later but dw

CC		= gcc
CFLAGS	= -Wall -Wextra -Werror
NAME	= libft.a

# AR is an archiving tool: r = Insert the files | s = Write an object-file index (ranlib) | c = Create
AR		= ar rsc

SRCS 	= #TODO: Create .c files
OBJS    = $(SRCS:.c=.o)// gimme the mouse
